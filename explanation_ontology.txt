every subclass of domain concept is disjointed with another sibling class
except for warehouse, quadrant, row and shelf, this because for object that have a relation part-whole logically they are different but ontologically they mustn't 
Quadrant results to be a subclass of Warehouse, but this works logically, since a Warehouse could be composed by only one quadrant or more

be disjointed to allow inference, since there maybe some inference chains, that get inconsistent with disjointness
chemicals can be hazardous (toxicItem e.g. corrosive acid), or not (e.g. sodium bicarbonate), however in the second case they are still labeled as chemicals 
(there are still hazards but very minimal)

property restriction some means every element of the domain has "at least one" related element in the range through that relation (infers existance)
e.g. Warehouse hasQuadrant some Quadrant -> being a Warehouse means it must have at least one Quadrant (necessary cond) = every Warehouse has at least one quadrant
e.g. Item storedOn some Shelf -> every item is stored at least on one shelf
property restriction only means if an element of the domain has that specific relation than it must point to the related element in the range given by that relation 
(infers constraint -> "if there is it must be like this" )
e.g, Warehouse hasQuadrant only Quadrant -> if a Warehouse is in a relation hasQuadrant then it must be with a Quadrant, but there can also be none (nor necessary nor sufficient) =
    = if a warehouse has quadrants, they must be quadrants (seems trivial, but it's important in logic)
e.g. Item storedOn only Shelf -> if an item is stored, it must be stored on a shelf

together they do: every Warehouse has at least one relation with Quadrant, and only Quadrant

Classes:

- Drone:
disjointed with everything (logically holds)
homesAt only with RechargingStation, and at least one (there may be multiple RechargingStation that it can call "home")

- Item:
disjointed with everything (logically holds)
extacly 1 OCR code (unique identifier)
stordeOn only and exactly 1 shelf -> exactly one, and only shelves are in relation "storedOn" with Item

    - ChemicalItem:
    disjointed with EdibleItem
    stordeOn only and exactly 1 sealed shelf -> exactly one, and only sealedshelves are in relation "storedOn" with ChemicalItem

    - EdibleItem:
    disjointed with ChemicalItem and HazardousItem
    stordeOn only either on refrigerated or standard shelf -> only with those types of shelves there is a relation "storedOn" with EdibleItem,
    it would be inclusive, however the "exactly 1" restriction applied on storedOn in the super class Item makes it exclusive (either on the standard or refrigerated, not both)

    - FragileItem:
    no disjoints (any type of item can be fragile)
    stordeOn only on a shelf that is in the bottom row (created using "Class expression editor" section in "SubClass of" and pasting "storedOn only (Shelf and (inRow some BottomRow))")
     -> fragile items can be in any shelf (no disjoints), but must be in bottom row (avoid braking if they fall)

Properties:

- hasPart: superclass for the structural properties
            transitive -> Warehouse hasQuadrant Quadrant and Quadrant hasRow Row can create Warehouse hasRow Row

- hasQuadrant:  asymmetric -> quadrant cannot be in relation hasQuadrant with Warehouse
                irreflexive -> quadrant cannot be in relation hasQuadrant with Quadrant

- hasRow:  asymmetric -> Row cannot be in relation hasRow with Quadrant
            irreflexive -> Row cannot be in relation hasRow with Row

- hasShelf:  asymmetric -> Shelf cannot be in relation hasShelf with Row
                irreflexive -> Shelf cannot be in relation hasShelf with Shelf

- hasRechargingStation: not functional -> allows warehouse to have multiple RechargingStation

- homesAt: not functional -> allows a drone to home at multiple RS (indeed the property is applied with restriction some (at least 1 or more), but even if it was functional, 
"some" would still work, since "exaclty 1" in "at least 1" is consistent with functional, however "exactly 2 or more" is inconsistent with functional)
           asymmetric -> RS cannot use a Drone as its home
           irreflexive -> a drone cannot be its own home
