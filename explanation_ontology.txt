Property restriction some means every element of the domain has "at least one" related element in the range through that relation (infers existance)
e.g. Warehouse hasQuadrant some Quadrant -> being a Warehouse means it must have at least one Quadrant (necessary cond) = every Warehouse has at least one quadrant
e.g. Item storedOn some Shelf -> every item is stored at least on one shelf
property restriction only means if an element of the domain has that specific relation than it must point to the related element in the range given by that relation 
(infers constraint -> "if there is it must be like this" )
e.g, Warehouse hasQuadrant only Quadrant -> if a Warehouse is in a relation hasQuadrant then it must be with a Quadrant, but there can also be none (nor necessary nor sufficient) =
    = if a warehouse has quadrants, they must be quadrants (seems trivial, but it's important in logic)
e.g. Item storedOn only Shelf -> if an item is stored, it must be stored on a shelf
together they do: every Warehouse has at least one relation with Quadrant, and only Quadrant

Absence of disjointness does NOT force overlap

Classes:
every subclass of domain concept is disjointed with another sibling class
except for warehouse, quadrant, row and shelf, this because for object that have a relation part-whole logically they are different but ontologically they mustn't 
Quadrant results to be a subclass of Warehouse, but this works logically, since a Warehouse could be composed by only one quadrant or more
They are disjointed to allow inference chains, and they may get inconsistent with disjointness

- Drone:
disjointed with everything (logically holds)
homesAt only with RechargingStation, and at least one (there may be multiple RechargingStation that it can call "home")

-FlyEvent:
disjointed with everything (logically holds)
performedBy only and some Drone -> in relation performedBy only with Drone and multiple drones can do this operation
scansItem only and some Item -> in relation scansItem only with Item and multiple items can be scanned during this operation (at least one) -> 
operation of scanning means looking at an item

    - AntiTheftEvent:
    disjoint with ScanEvent, represents an operation to check if the quantity of goods is consistent with the internal db of the drone 

    - ScansEvent:
    disjoint with AntiTheftEvent, represents operation of simple scanning of eventual new goods

- Item:
disjointed with everything (logically holds)
extacly 1 OCR code (unique identifier)
stordeOn only and exactly 1 shelf -> exactly one, and only shelves are in relation "storedOn" with Item

    - ChemicalItem:
    disjointed InfectiousItem, they could be all the other types included HazardousItem (except InfectiousItem) (e.g. colorants are edible as aswell), 
    but not necessarily (absence of disjointness doesn not force overlap)
    ChemicalItem can be hazardous (e.g. ToxicItem -> corrosive acid), or not (e.g. sodium bicarbonate), however in the second case they are still labeled as chemicals 
    (there are still hazards but very minimal)
    storedOn exaclty 1 Shelf -> inherited by Item superclass
    stordeOn only with sealed shelf or refrigerated shelf -> only SealedShelf or RefrigeratedShelf are in relation "storedOn" with ChemicalItem, 
    but or it's exclusive since can be stored on exaclty 1 shelf

    - EdibleItem:
    disjointed with ChemicalItem and HazardousItem
    storedOn exaclty 1 Shelf -> inherited by Item superclass
    stordeOn only either on refrigerated or standard shelf -> only with those types of shelves there is a relation "storedOn" with EdibleItem,
    it would be inclusive, however the "exactly 1" restriction applied on storedOn in the super class Item makes it exclusive (either on the standard or refrigerated, not both)

    - FragileItem:
    no disjoints (any type of item can be fragile)
    storedOn exaclty 1 Shelf -> inherited by Item superclass
    stordeOn only on a shelf that is in the bottom row (created using "Class expression editor" section in "SubClass of" and pasting "storedOn only (Shelf and (inRow some BottomRow))")
     -> fragile items can be in any shelf (no disjoints), but must be in bottom row (avoid braking if they fall)

    - HazardousItem: 
    disjointed with EdibleItem, composed by multiple subclasses, only InfectiousItem is disjoint with another class (ChemicalItem), 
    all the others aren't, but this doesn't force overlap (only disjointness forces absence of overlap)

        - ExplosiveItem:
        disjoints inherited by HazardousItem
        storedOn exaclty 1 Shelf -> inherited by Item superclass
        storedOn only sealed shelf or refrigerated shelf (exclusive for property restriction "exactly 1" of parent) ->  only RefrigeratedShelf or SealedShelf are
        in relation "storedOn" with ExplosiveItem 

        -InfectiousItem:
        disjoints inherited by HazardousItem + with ChemicalItem
        storedOn exaclty 1 Shelf -> inherited by Item superclass
        storedOn only sealed shelf or refrigerated shelf ->  only SealedShelf or RefrigeratedShelf are in relation "storedOn" with InfectiousItem,
        but or it's exclusive since can be stored on exaclty 1 shelf

        -RadioactiveItem:
        disjoints inherited by HazardousItem
        storedOn exaclty 1 Shelf -> inherited by Item superclass
        storedOn only radiocative shelf ->  only RadioactiveShelf is in relation "storedOn" with RadioactiveItem

        -ToxicItem:
        disjoints inherited by HazardousItem
        storedOn exaclty 1 Shelf -> inherited by Item superclass
        storedOn only sealed shelf ->  only SealedShelf is in relation "storedOn" with ToxicItem
    
    - LiquidItem:
    no disjoints (any type of item can be liquid)
    storedOn only and exaclty 1 Shelf -> inherited by Item superclass

- Quadrant: 
disjoint with all the other classes except the structural ones (Warehouse, Row, Shelf), this because, even though logically they are different, ontologically they may be linked through
some inference chain, this links may be disrupted by disjointness (also to avoid inconsistency error), because of this it can be a subclass of warehouse which make sense, 
since a single Quadrant can still be identiﬁed as a Warehouse
hasRow only with Row and at least 1 row -> relations hasRow only with classes Row, and at least one of them

    - ChemicalQuadrant:
    disjointed with all the other subclasses
    hasRow only (Row and (hasShelf only (RefrigeratedShelf or SealedShelf))) -> in its rows has only shelves that are either RefrigeratedShelf or SealedShelf

    - EdibleQuadrant:
    disjointed with all the other subclasses
    hasRow only (Row and (hasShelf only (RefrigeratedShelf or StandardShelf))) -> in its rows has only shelves that are either RefrigeratedShelf or StandardShelf

    - HazmatQuadrant:
    disjointed with all the other subclasses
    hasRow only (Row and (hasShelf only (RefrigeratedShelf or SealedShelf or RadioactiveShieldingShelf))) -> in its rows has only shelves that are either
    RefrigeratedShelf or RadioactiveShieldingShelf or SealedShelf

    - StandardQuadrant:
    disjointed with all the other subclasses
    hasRow only (Row and (hasShelf only StandardShelf)) -> in its rows has only shelves that are StandardShelf


- Shelf: SealedShelf and RefrigeratedShelf may not be disjointed, since ChemicalItem could need to be in a shelf which is both sealed and refrigerated, 
same for InfectiousItem or  ExplosiveItem 


Properties:

- hasPart: superclass for the structural properties
            transitive -> Warehouse hasQuadrant Quadrant and Quadrant hasRow Row can create Warehouse hasRow Row

- hasQuadrant:  asymmetric -> quadrant cannot be in relation hasQuadrant with Warehouse
                irreflexive -> quadrant cannot be in relation hasQuadrant with Quadrant

- hasRow:  asymmetric -> Row cannot be in relation hasRow with Quadrant
            irreflexive -> Row cannot be in relation hasRow with Row

- hasShelf:  asymmetric -> Shelf cannot be in relation hasShelf with Row
                irreflexive -> Shelf cannot be in relation hasShelf with Shelf

- hasRechargingStation: not functional -> allows warehouse to have multiple RechargingStation

- homesAt: not functional -> allows a drone to home at multiple RS (indeed the property is applied with restriction some (at least 1 or more), but even if it was functional, 
"some" would still work, since "exaclty 1" in "at least 1" is consistent with functional, however "exactly 2 or more" is inconsistent with functional)
           asymmetric -> RS cannot use a Drone as its home
           irreflexive -> a drone cannot be its own home

- ScansItem: it means when it activates the scanner (it happens at least 1 time when it flies away)
